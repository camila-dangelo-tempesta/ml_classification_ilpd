# **Classification of patients with liver disease**

## Supervised machine learning of classification of patients with liver diseases

Over the years, the number of patients with liver disease has continuously increased due to excessive consumption of alcohol, inhalation of harmful gases, ingestion of contaminated food and use of drugs and anabolic steroids.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

In this project we will build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether a patient will or will not develop liver disease based on several characteristics of the patient. This model can help doctors, hospitals or governments better plan thehealth spending budget or even create prevention policies.

Since our goal is to predict a class (yes or no), we will use learning supervised for classification, creating different versions of the model with different
algorithms and we will go through the entire Machine Learning process from end to end.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

This dataset contains liver patient records and non-liver patient records.
liver samples collected in India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide the
groups in liver patients (who have liver disease) or not (without disease).

This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records.
The data set was collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not). 
This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

We will use as a data source the dataset available at the link [ILPD](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset))
